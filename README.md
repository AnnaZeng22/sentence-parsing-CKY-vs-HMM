# Introduction
The CKY algorithm is a parsing algorithm that takes a sequence and a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and determines whether it can be parsed into a sentence. 

# Files
rules.txt stores a large CFG.

pos files.zip compresses all the files containing part-of-speech tagged sentences from the same corpus derived rules.txt from.

sentences.txt contains sentences to assess two algorithms.


# Approaches 
We construct CKY and HMM algorithms through Python. CKY is a parsing algorithm takes a sequence and a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, determines whether it can be parsed into a sentence, and goes probabilistic by multiplying probabilities of sentence components. HMM uses the part-ofspeech tagged sentences from a usage-based corpus to estimate its parameters, thus calculating the probabilities
of success in sentence parsing.

# Findings 
 Comparing between algorithms, HMM offers competitive probabilities than CKY. Then we replacethe old probability with the new one estimated by probabilistic ruleâ€™s (CFG) parameters. Now, compared within the CKY algorithm, new grammar enhances probabilities compared to the old one.
